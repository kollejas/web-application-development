<h1>Web Application Development</h1>
<p>Web Application Development is a course at the study degree program <a href="https://www.fh-joanneum.at/msd">Mobile Software Development</a> and we will cover different topics in Web Engineering e.g. HTML, CSS, JS, ...</p>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>We are using <a href="https://wiki.selfhtml.org/" target="_blank" title="selfhtml tutorial and wiki page with tips and tricks for everybody">HTML</a> to create our document structure, where we will include content.</p>
<p>HTML is only to represent content and not style. We are able to add e.g. <strong>strong-Tags</strong> which will be displayed as bold elements, but strong is be used to focus / point important details. <b>bold-tag</b> specifies text to display bold font without any special importance.<br/> Those two tags have different meanings for Search Engine Optimization, so take care how and when to use which Tag. </p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS is responsible to beautify and style our structured content.</p>
<p>It's easily possible to change style for different use cases, e.g. to display / style the HTML content for desktop or mobile usage.</p>
<h2>JS</h2>
<p>We will add special behaviour to our website with JS.</p>
<p>Interactive websites, Animations, Data Manipulation, ... will be possible without complete reloading of the previously loaded webpage.</p>
